Hello! I'm Tulasi,

I'm interested in software engineering and embedded software development. I have worked on several small projects in the past and am now trying to keep up with it by working on new projects after a slight gap. At the moment I'm working on a ecommerce site and blog website projects. I'm upskilling myself in order to make them complete fuctional working projects.
